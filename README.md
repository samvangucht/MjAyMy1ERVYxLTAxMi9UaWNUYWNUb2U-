# Tic Tac Toe Terminal Application

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in a terminal-based application. The game can be played
between two players on a 3x3 board.

# Getting Started

To run the application, you need to have Java 17 or later installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samvangucht/MjAyMy1ERVYxLTAxMi9UaWNUYWNUb2U-.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd TicTacToe
```

3. Compile the source code:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
java -jar ./build/libs/TicTacToe-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

# How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 board.

Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the board.

The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all positions on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

To make a move, enter the position number (1-9) where you want to place your mark when prompted.

The game will display the current board after each move and will also finish when the game is over.
